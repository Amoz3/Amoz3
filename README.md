# What I'm Currently Working On

I am currently working on developing a REST API that is designed to solve the Funcaptcha audio challenges using signal analysis & machine learning. The API takes the challenge as input and uses signal analysis and machine learning algorithms to accurately determine the answer before returning it to the user.
